# Basic maze environment #

This 

This maze project is about a robot that will learn, after multiple attempts, how to reach the exit. 
It uses reinforcement learning by giving a reward every time he gets closer to the exit and a 
negative reward when it hits a wall of the maze. The maze environment code and the basic movement of 
the robot was given by the professor. As part of the final project for class EL5852 introduction to 
pattern recognition.
The code I made can be found in:
